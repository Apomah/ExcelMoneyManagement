My macros and spreadsheets for money management

These sheets are designed for personal use only. To use the sheets fill in the marked fields on MoneyMacros.txt and then pasta into a blank Visual Basic file, which can be accessed by performing the following:
--> Developer tab
--> Visual Basic under Code

I recommend creating the files by going to the VBAProject Manager on the side and perfomring the following:
--> VBAProject (PERSONAL.XLSB)
--> Right click Modules
--> Insert
--> Module

The macros can be run by performing the following:
--> Developer
--> Macros under code
--> Click "PERSONAL.XLSB!call_Budgeting_Subs"
--> Click "Run"
